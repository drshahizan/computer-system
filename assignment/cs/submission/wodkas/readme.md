## Case Study:

**Name:Shuhan Yang** 

**Matrix No:MEC232023** 

## Answer

1.For PEC CPU:
   
   Pros: Precise measurement of single-core and multi-core performance and Widely recognized in the industry

   Cons: License cost is high and Tests can be time-consuming

   For Geekbench:

   Pros: Cross-platform, suitable for various devices and Simple to run with varied scenarios

   Cons: imited features in free version and Results may be less detailed than SPEC

   Since A is a large technology company, I believe they should have a sufficient budget for funding and high requirements for testing results, so I would recommend using SPEC CPU as the tool for testing CPUs.

2.For CrystalDiskMark:

  Pros: imple interface, easy to use and Measures read/write performance, ideal for large file transfers
   
  Cons: Limited in complex workload simulation and Basic testing only
  
  For AS SSD:
  
  Pros: Focused on SSD performance and Tests sequential and random read/write
   
  Cons:  Lacks deep data analysis and Not ideal for HDDs

  Since A is a large technology company, I believe their research center's tools should be the best. However, HDDs are inferior to SSDs in terms of size and transfer speed, and AS SSD is specifically designed as a testing tool for SSD drives. Therefore, I recommend using AS SSD as the tool for testing hard drives.

3.The company needs to consider both idle power consumption and Performance per Watt (Perf/WattÔºâ.
  Idle power is critical in data centers where servers are always online, even with variable load. High idle consumption can increase operational expenses over time, so selecting hardware with minimal idle power is essential.
 Performance per Watt (Perf/Watt) is crucial for balancing performance needs with energy costs. High-performance hardware that remains energy efficient under full load can significantly reduce cooling requirements, lower electricity costs, and help maintain consistent performance during peak times.
 Prioritizing hardware with low idle power and high performance per watt will optimize TechSolutions‚Äô data center operational efficiency. Reduced energy consumption translates directly into cost savings over time, not only in power expenses but also by decreasing the cooling demands. These metrics ensure that each component in the configuration contributes to cost-effective, sustainable operations while meeting TechSolutions‚Äô growth and performance targets
