## Case Study:

**Name: Chan Chen Lam** 

**Matrix No: MEC232019** 

## Answer

### 1. Which benchmarking tools would you recommend TechSolutions Inc. prioritize for evaluating CPU performance, and why? Consider the company‚Äôs focus on both single-core and multi-core performance for CPU-intensive applications.

**Benchmark Tools:** SPEC CPU vs Geekbench </br>
**Suggested Tool:** SPEC CPU

**Reason:** SPEC CPU produces comprehensive evaluations of CPUs intended for high performance applications and cloud computing as compared to Geekbench, which usually useful for initial evaluation and quick comparisons. The company can utilise the strength of both benchmark tools, where Geekbench is used for preliminary benchmarking to narrow down the options, and after that to use SPEC CPU to do depth performance analysis of the shortlisted hardware. Since the company would like to expand its data centre business and it would be a large and long term investment, it is suggested to have more comprehensive and in-depth benchmarking.  </br></br>


### 2. How should TechSolutions Inc. approach storage benchmarking to ensure optimal data retrieval speed and reliability for its cloud computing services? Discuss which tools would be effective for assessing both read/write speeds and random access times.

**Benchmark Tools:** CrystalDiskMark vs AS SSD </br>
**Suggested Tool:** AS SSD

**Reason:** Since the company targets for a high speed data storage, SSD will definitely be one of the consideration. Therefore, AS SSD is suggested to be used to benchmark the storage performances. AS SSD measures the read/write speeds as well as the random access times, also it is best suited for the evaluations of performance of applications that rely heavily on random access speed such as the datacentre. Meanwhile, CrystalDiskMark only be useful for general purpose evaluations on the HDDs and SSDs. </br></br>

### 3. What considerations should the IT team keep in mind regarding power efficiency when selecting hardware based on benchmarking results? Analyze the impact of idle power consumption and performance per watt on long-term operational costs.

**Benchmark Tools:** 3DMark vs FurMark </br>
**Suggested Tool:** FurMark

**Reason:** As the company would like to understand the power consumption and performance per watt on long term operation cost, FurMark is suitable to be used as compared to 3D mark. FurMark is a stress-testing tool where it can be used to access the stability and thermal performance of GPUs under extreme loads. With this, it can be use to simulate the long term operational costs that includes the power and cooling solution cost, as well as the maintenance and downtime. Meanwhile, 3DMark often used to measure the gaming performance such as the frame rates, gaming performance for different resolutions, therefore it is not so useful to the company. </br></br>
